# Flutter test app

Flutter test app made with Dart.

## Summary

Flutter test app for trying out software development for different platforms with Flutter, and Dart.

## Background

This project started as a playground for trying out software development for different platforms with Flutter, and Dart. This is also a learning project for both Flutter framework and Dart language. Because of this the app might include things that would not be useful in any real case scenario software.

## How is it used?

Run the project app with command line with command ``flutter run`` from the project's main directory.

After running the app, the app can be hot reloaded with ``r``.

Quit the app with ``q``.

## What next?

Trying out Flutter, and Dart development
* Try things out with both Flutter, and Dart
* Make an app that does something maybe useful
* Try using an external api with Dart and Flutter and use data from that api in the app

## Acknowledgments

* Do not use code, images, data etc. from others without permission.
